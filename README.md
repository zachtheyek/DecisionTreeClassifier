Midterm project for SUNY Fredonia's (Fall 2021) CSIT-496: Machine Learning course. 

`sklearn_decision_tree.ipynb` provides a template using Scikit-learn's built-in objects and methods. The train/validation set is located in the `data` directory, and the final result is visualized in the `fig` directory.

A final implementation of Hunt's Algorithm is documented in `decision_tree.ipynb`.
